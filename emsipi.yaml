# EMSIPI CONFIGURATION FILE -- READ THIS FIRST
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# This is the specification of the configuration file for emsipi:
#
# 1. You can have a private configuration file called `emsipi.private.yaml`,
#    which should not be tracked by git, and whose values will override the
#    values in `emsipi.yaml`.
# 2. Any value beginning with `<` is a placeholder, and will be ignored by
#    emsipi. If you have to pass a value that contains `<`, you can escape it
#    by using `\<`.

# The name of the MCP server.
# Mandatory.
server-name: emsipi-simple-server

# Configuration for the cloud provider (or providers) you want to use. Put each
# configuration in a separate block. For now, only 'google' (GCP) is supported.

    # Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project ID.

# Environment variables that will be available to the MCP server, regardless of
# the session. They will be passed as environment variables to the MCP server.
# For now, only "flat" environment variables are supported (e.g. no nested
# dictionaries).

# Example:
# environment-variables:
#   MY_VARIABLE: "my-value"
#   ANOTHER_VARIABLE: "another-value"
